        <h1>Engineering is nothing but art</h1>
        <p> We engineers are artists. Physics talks about symmetry, we meddle with symmetry. Just like physicists, engineers have something to deliver to this world. Engineering is ingenuity. If you want to make something move, you would start thinking. The thinking is initiated by a need, a task at hand. The thinking process would drives learning, design, and ultimately create. That is Engineering.</p>

        <h1>Engineering is not bounded by anything </h1>
        <p>We have to think about cost, human resourses needed, how a product could be transported, how it would initiate industry, give employment. So engineering involves economics and management too. If I were given a task to make a fan temperature controlled, I would study the problem to the core. I am not interested in what is going on inside the black body</p>
